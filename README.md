# Tim's Portfolio Site

This is the codebase for https://www.timtrautman.com.  I built it from scratch using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a framework for building fast static sites using React and GraphQL.

The main goal of this site is to help viewers understand who I am, what I've done, and what my work looks like.
